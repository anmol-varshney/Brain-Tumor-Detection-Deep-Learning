# 😎 Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning on Brain-MRI-Images Dataset

In this file, simulating a convolutional neural network which is a topic in deep learning. We are using this convolutional neural network to classify images. The dataset we are using is “Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection”. The simulation is done to understand the working of deep neural networks in classification of images. In the result we have shown the performance of the neural network through many metrics like “accuracy”, “precision”, “recall” etc. The result also discusses the significance of convolutional neural networks in the pool of artificial neural networks in classification of images.
#### About Dataset

The dataset we are using is “Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection”. The dataset contains MRI images of the brain to find if the brain has a tumor or not. This dataset contains a total of 253 images. These images are divided in two classes namely: ‘yes’ and ‘no’. ‘yes’ defines that the brain has a tumor and ‘no’ defines that it does not. 

The images in the dataset are not evenly divided into the classes. There are 155 images in the ‘yes’ group and 98 images in the ‘no’ group.  The images in the dataset are not standardized to common size. The images are of different sizes from 200x200 px to 900x900 px.
